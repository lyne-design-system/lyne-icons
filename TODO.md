- Currently, the Design Tokens will get released immediately. Would it make sense to first create a pull request?
- The new Design Tokens need to be installed manually in lyne-components. would it make sense to:
  - ... trigger a build of lyne-components automatically?
  - ... create a pull requests at lyne-components with the new Design Tokens?
- travis -> 2 stages for tokens and icons. If only one stage is triggered, everything is fine. But if one commits something in this repo without according env-variable, both stages will run -> semantic release and trigger lyne-components will run 2 times!!
- update documentation with icon workflow
- add description to figma file for icons
